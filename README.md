## About the Project

- This project was built to allow the user the ability to schedule their work day and allow visibility on past, current and future action items.
- The motiviation for this project was to utilize JQuery and moment.js skills to create an application for users to schedule their work day.
- The current day and date will show at the top of the page once the page is loaded.
- Once the user inputs their task and saves it, the task will still be visible upon reload.
- The time blocks are color coordinated depending on the current time of day.  
- If the time for the task has passed, the time block will be gray.
- If the time for the task is current, the time block will be red.
- If the time for the task is for the future, the time block will be green.
- Comments have been added to the HTML, CSS and JS files to clarify each step and make future updates easier.
